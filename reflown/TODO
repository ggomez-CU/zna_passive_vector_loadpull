* [x] Implement all drivers except NRX power meter
* [ ] Write NRX power meter driver (input calibration only)
* [x] Keep existing VNA, tuner, and bias driver structures
* [ ] Add bench-limits YAML (power, Γ, VSWR, tuner safe region, etc.)
* [x] Maintain current calibration YAML for VNA error terms
* [ ] Implement VNA SOLT → probe/coax calibration routine
* [ ] Fetch and store VNA error terms to cal YAML
* [ ] Calibrate tuner SOLT after tuner path
* [ ] Calibrate power using NRX at DUT input
* [ ] Log calibration metadata (timestamp, bench limits, operator)
* [ ] Add tuner calibration verification (compare Γ target vs. measured)
* [ ] Support multi-dimensional sweeps (freq × power × Γ)
* [x] Apply de-embedding using saved error terms
* [ ] Validate zero gain (Pin vs. Pout from VNA)
* [ ] Enforce bench limits (power, Γ, VSWR, safe tuner region)
* [ ] Add overpower monitor (VNA now → NRX later)
* [ ] Implement graceful shutdown (tuner reset, RF off, bias off)
* [ ] Add VNA connection-loss handling with safe shutdown
* [ ] Write operator README with calibration and validation guide
* [ ] Add preflight sanity test (instrument SCPI ping, tuner Γ check, receiver linearity)
